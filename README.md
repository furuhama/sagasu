Codesearch for your own files

## Idea

- Generic search engine for private storage (also works well for public storage, of course)
- Internally, use [codesearch](https://github.com/google/codesearch) as a search engine
- Treats as a JSON web server which is able to take regexp(RE2) as a query

## Usage
